## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 1.11]
- [Gradle ]

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `org.synechron.wells.Azure2PcfApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use :

gradle bootRun
```
